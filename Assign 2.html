      <strong>Website Development</strong> <br />
      <br />

      Keita Yamada’s website is clean and concise. This web developer portfolio
      consists of three sections – the homepage with his bio, <br />
      a dedicated project page, and a contact page. An interesting aspect of his
      portfolio’s design <br />
      is that visitors can switch between light and dark themes by clicking on
      the options in the lower-left corner of the website.
